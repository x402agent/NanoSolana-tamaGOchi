## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-25

**First public release.** Everything below shipped across v1.0.0–v1.4.1 (293 commits, 185 PRs).

### Core
- **On-device AI agent** — Claude (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) running 24/7 as an Android foreground service via embedded Node.js (nodejs-mobile, Node 18 LTS ARM64)
- **56 tools** — file I/O, shell exec, web search/fetch, device sensors, Solana transactions, MCP remote tools, and more
- **35 skills** — bundled YAML-frontmatter skills with semantic trigger routing, plus install-from-URL and Telegram file attachment
- **Multi-turn tool use** — up to 25 tool-call rounds per conversation turn with per-round checkpoints and crash-safe resume
- **Prompt caching** — reduces cost and latency on repeated context across Claude API calls

### Telegram
- Full bot integration — reactions, inline keyboards, file send/download, blockquote rendering, typing indicators
- 12 slash commands — /help, /version, /logs, /approve, /deny, and more
- File sharing with Claude vision (send an image, agent sees it)
- Owner-gate hardening — blocks service start without valid Telegram owner ID

### Solana
- **Jupiter DEX** — swaps, quotes, limit orders, DCA via Jupiter Ultra API with sign-only MWA flow
- **Mobile Wallet Adapter** (MWA) integration for on-device transaction signing
- Wallet & secrets protection with encrypted credentials store (Android Keystore, AES-256-GCM)

### Device Control
- **Android Bridge** — local HTTP bridge exposing battery, storage, network, GPS, camera, SMS, calls, clipboard, TTS, contacts, app launch/listing
- **Screenshots** — agent captures screen via `screencap -p`
- **34 shell commands** in sandboxed allowlist (ls, cat, grep, find, curl, wget, sed, diff, base64, screencap, and more)
- **Boot receiver** — auto-start agent after device reboot
- **Watchdog** — 30s health checks with auto-restart on unresponsive Node.js

### Intelligence
- **Persistent memory** — daily notes, personality, ranked keyword search across memory files (SQL.js backed)
- **Web search** — Brave, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity with zero-config DDG fallback
- **Web fetch** — markdown conversion, caching, redirect handling
- **Cron/scheduling** — one-shot or recurring jobs with natural language time parsing ("remind me in 30 min")
- **Remote MCP servers** — add external tool providers via Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- **Auto session summary** — agent saves memory before session dies
- **Ephemeral session awareness** — agent knows when Node.js restarted mid-conversation

### Security
- Prompt injection defense with content trust scoring
- Tool confirmation gates (YES/NO for dangerous actions)
- Secrets blocked from agent access (config files, database)
- js_eval sandbox for in-process code execution
- Setup-token authentication for initial configuration

### Android App
- **Jetpack Compose + Material 3** — DarkOps theme (dark navy + crimson + green)

### Architecture
- **14 focused Node.js modules** — main, claude, tools, solana, telegram, memory, skills, cron, web, database, security, bridge, config, mcp-client (refactored from 6,924-line monolith)
- **API resilience** — retry with exponential backoff on 429/529, rate-limit-aware throttling, centralized API wrapper with mutex
- **Firebase Analytics** build-optional — build succeeds without google-services.json
- **OpenClaw parity** synced to v2026.2.25 (reviewed 936+ upstream commits)

### Open Source
