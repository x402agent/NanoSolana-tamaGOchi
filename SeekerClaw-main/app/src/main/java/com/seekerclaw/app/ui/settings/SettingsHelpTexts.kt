        "Run \"claude setup-token\" on any machine with Claude Code installed — " +
        "it'll give you a token to paste here. " +
        "Great if you don't want to deal with API keys. " +
        "Temporary = it expires, so grab a fresh one if it stops working."

        "Keeps the display awake while the agent runs. " +
        "Useful when using camera automation on a dedicated device. " +

        "Lets the agent know your phone's location. " +
        "Useful for location-based tasks like weather, nearby places, or navigation. " +
        "The agent only checks location when you ask — it doesn't track you in the background."

    const val CONTACTS =
        "Lets the agent read your contacts list. " +
        "This allows it to look up names and phone numbers when you ask, for example \"text Mom\" or \"call John\". " +
        "Your contacts are never sent to the cloud — only used on-device to resolve names."

    const val SMS =
        "Lets the agent send text messages on your behalf. " +

    const val PHONE_CALLS =
        "Lets the agent make phone calls for you. " +
        "It will always confirm the number with you before dialing. " +
        "Useful for quick calls like \"call the pizza place\"."

    // ── MCP Servers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

    const val MCP_SERVERS =
        "MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give your agent extra tools from external services. " +
        "Add a server URL, optionally an auth token, and your agent discovers its tools on startup. " +
        "Remote only — your phone just makes HTTP calls. " +
        "Restart the agent after adding or changing servers."

    // ── Solana Wallet ──────────────────────────────────────────────

    const val JUPITER_API_KEY =
        "Optional. Required for Solana token swaps via Jupiter aggregator. " +
        "Get a free key at portal.jup.ag (free tier: 60 req/min). " +
        "Without this, swap and quote tools will not work."

        "Get a free key at helius.dev (free tier: 50k requests/day). " +
