## Data Storage

### Config — `nutrition/config.json`

```javascript
read({ path: "nutrition/config.json" })
```

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "height_cm": 180,
    "weight_kg": 85,
    "age": 30,
    "sex": "male",
    "activity_level": "moderate",
    "goal": "cut"
  },

    "fat": 67
  },
  "preferences": {
    "units": "metric",
    "auto_log_photos": true
  }
}
```

### Daily Log — `nutrition/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

```json
{
  "date": "2026-02-18",
  "meals": [
    {
      "id": "m1708250000000",

}
```

### Weight History — `nutrition/weight.json`

```json
{ "entries": [{ "date": "2026-02-18", "kg": 85.0 }] }
```

## First-Time Setup

If `nutrition/config.json` doesn't exist, ask the user:
1. Height, weight, age, sex
2. Activity level (sedentary / light / moderate / active / very active)
3. Goal: cut (lose fat), maintain, or bulk (gain muscle)

Calculate TDEE using **Mifflin-St Jeor**:

```
Male:   BMR = 10 × weight_kg + 6.25 × height_cm − 5 × age − 5
Female: BMR = 10 × weight_kg + 6.25 × height_cm − 5 × age − 161

Activity multipliers:
  sedentary = 1.2    light = 1.375    moderate = 1.55
  active = 1.725     very_active = 1.9

TDEE = BMR × multiplier
```

Set targets based on goal:
- **Cut**: calories = TDEE × 0.80, protein = 2.0 g/kg bodyweight
- **Maintain**: calories = TDEE × 1.00, protein = 1.6 g/kg
- **Bulk**: calories = TDEE × 1.10, protein = 1.8 g/kg
- **Fat**: remaining calories after protein, split ~30% fat / rest carbs

Use `js_eval` for the math, then save config:

```javascript
write({ path: "nutrition/config.json", content: JSON.stringify(config, null, 2) })
```

Show a welcome dashboard confirming their targets.

### Logging a Meal (text)

1. Read today's log: `read({ path: "nutrition/YYYY-MM-DD.json" })` — create if missing
2. Parse the food description, estimate calories/macros
3. Determine `meal_type` from time of day: before 10am → breakfast, 10am-2pm → lunch, 2pm-5pm → snack, after 5pm → dinner (or use user's label)
4. Generate entry with `id: "m" + Date.now()`, add to `meals` array
5. Write back: `write({ path: "nutrition/YYYY-MM-DD.json", content: ... })`
6. Show quick dashboard

### Logging Water

1. Parse amount: "500ml", "2 glasses" (1 glass = 250ml), "1 liter"
2. Add to today's `water_ml` total
3. Confirm: "💧 +500ml — Total today: 2,000ml"

## Photo Analysis Protocol

When user sends a food photo, the image arrives as a vision content block — analyze it directly.

1. **Identify** all visible food items and estimate portions
2. **Visual cues**: plate size (standard = 26cm), utensils for scale, packaging/labels
3. **Estimate** per-item: calories, protein, carbs, fat
4. **Confidence**: `high` (packaged/simple/single item), `medium` (restaurant/mixed plate), `low` (unclear/blurry/partial view)
5. **If low confidence**: ask user to clarify portion size or ingredients before logging
6. **Log as one entry** with all items listed in `items` array, combined totals in the main fields
7. Show quick dashboard

```

### Regional Foods

| Food | Serving | Cal | Protein |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Khinkali | 1 piece | 70 | 4g |
| Khachapuri (Adjarian) | 1 serving | 500 | 18g |
| Lobio | 1 serving | 250 | 12g |
| Mtsvadi (pork skewer) | 1 skewer | 300 | 25g |
| Churchkhela | 1 piece | 200 | 3g |

## Estimation Guidelines

- **Portions**: palm = ~100g meat, fist = ~1 cup, thumb = ~1 tbsp, cupped hand = ~½ cup
- **Restaurant meals**: estimate +20% for hidden butter/oil
- **Homemade**: use standard recipes unless user specifies
- **When uncertain**: give a range ("~400-500 cal"), log the midpoint, note `"confidence": "low"`
- **Always round**: nearest 5 cal, nearest 1g macro

## Cron Integration

Suggest reminders during setup. Supported time formats: `"every N days"`, `"every N hours"`, `"in N minutes"`, `"at Xam/pm"`, `"tomorrow at Xam"`.

```javascript
// Daily check-in (every 24 hours — create at morning time so it fires mornings)
cron_create({ name: "CalClaw breakfast", message: "🍳 Good morning! What did you have for breakfast?", time: "every 1 day" })

// Daily evening reminder (every 24 hours — create at evening time so it fires evenings)
cron_create({ name: "CalClaw dinner", message: "🌙 Don't forget to log dinner before bed!", time: "every 1 day" })

// Weekly summary (every 7 days)
cron_create({ name: "CalClaw weekly", message: "📊 Time for your weekly CalClaw summary! Say 'week' to see it.", time: "every 7 days" })
```

Note: Recurring crons fire at the interval from creation time. Create morning reminders in the morning and evening reminders in the evening so they fire at the right time of day.

## Error Handling

- **Blurry/unclear photo** → "I can't quite make out the food. Could you retake the photo or describe what you ate?"
- **Missing config** → trigger first-time setup automatically
- **Corrupted daily file** → try to parse what's salvageable, create fresh if unrecoverable, warn user
- **No meals logged today** → "No meals logged yet today. Send a photo or tell me what you ate!"
- **Missing daily file for `week`** → show "— (no data)" for that day
