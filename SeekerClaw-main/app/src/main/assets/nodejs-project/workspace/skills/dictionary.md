# Dictionary

Look up word definitions using the Free Dictionary API.

## When to Use

User asks about:
- Word definitions ("What does 'ephemeral' mean?")
- Pronunciation ("How do you pronounce 'quinoa'?")
- Word usage ("Use 'ubiquitous' in a sentence")
- Synonyms/antonyms
- Etymology ("Where does 'algorithm' come from?")

## API Endpoint

```javascript
web_fetch({
  url: "https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/ephemeral"
})
```

Replace `ephemeral` with the word to look up.

## Response Structure

The API returns:
```json
[{
  "word": "ephemeral",
  "phonetic": "/ɪˈfɛm(ə)rəl/",
  "phonetics": [{ "text": "/ɪˈfɛm(ə)rəl/", "audio": "..." }],
  "meanings": [{
    "partOfSpeech": "adjective",
    "definitions": [{
      "definition": "Lasting for a very short time.",
      "example": "Fashions are ephemeral.",
      "synonyms": ["transitory", "fleeting"],
      "antonyms": ["permanent", "lasting"]
    }]
  }],
  "origin": "Late 16th century: from Greek ephēmeros..."
}]
